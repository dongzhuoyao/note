## [Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information)

I(X;Y)=0 if X and Y is unrelated. otherwise I(X;Y) is larger than zero.

Intuitively, mutual information measures the information that X and Y share: It measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other. If X=Y+3 or X=Y^3, which means X is a deterministic function of Y and vice versa, then mutual information I(X;Y) is the entropy of Y(or X).

**Property**:  Non-negativity, and Symmetry.

Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):

$$
NMI(A;B) = \frac{I(A;B)}{\sqrt{H(A)H(B)}}
$$

Similarly, representations may be pre-trained on any data, VTAB permits supervised, unsupervised, or other pre-training strategy. There is one constraint: the evaluation datasets must not be used during pre-training. This constraint is designed to mitigate overfitting to the evaluation tasks.



**[Noise Contrastive Estimation](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a/gutmann10a.pdf)**

A broadly used method in NLP, also used in [CPC: Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding,Arxiv18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748), [Unsupervised Feature Learning via Non-Parametric Instance Discrimination,CVPR18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01978.pdf), etc.

Originally proposed in 2010, used in NLP from [this paper: A fast and simple algorithm for training neural probabilistic language models](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/ncelm.pdf). In NLP, NCE fixes the value of normalizer Z, making the inference (if you need probability values) faster. You don't need to sum over all the vocabulary to get the normalizer value.


The reason why NCE loss will work is because NCE approximates maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) when the ratio of noise to real data ùëò increases.


Negative Sample is a special case of NCE, for reason you can check the [summary of approximating softmax](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2650720050&idx=2&sn=9fedc937d3128462c478ef7911e77687&chksm=871b034cb06c8a5a8db8a10f708c81025fc62084d871ac5d184bab5098cb64e939c1c23a7369&mpshare=1&scene=1&srcid=0613xBLYGgZUw99YG99QMP6p#rd), also you can check a detailed comparison between negative sample and NCE in [this note: Notes on Noise Contrastive Estimation and Negative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8251.pdf)



**[A fast and simple algorithm for training neural probabilistic language models](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/ncelm.pdf)**

Motivation of this work is based on the following points:

- gradient-based back propogation is a must.
- We cannot sum over all vocabulary to get the normalizer value, then we need to approximate it.
- Why not approximate it from the perspective of gradient?
- softmax classifier summarize the classification problem as a N-class problem, NCE summarizes the classification problem as a binary-class problem. Even though, the gradient derivation pattern is similar.

Equation 10 can be derived by normal derivation rule.

Equation 11 is from the definition of expectation. 

TODO, why Equation 12 is the Maximum Likelihood gradient

use noise-contrastive estimation[NCE] 

The conceptual change from class weight vector wj to feature representation vj directly is significant.
The weight vectors {wj} in the original softmax formulation are only valid for training classes. Consequently, they are not generalized to new classes, or in our setting, new instances. When we get rid of these weight vectors, our learning objective focuses entirely on the feature representation and its induced metric, which can be applied everywhere in the space and to any new instances at the test.


Computing the non-parametric softmax above is cost prohibitive when the number of classes n(n images in the dataset) is very large, e.g. at the scale of millions.  The solution is to cast the multi(n)-class classification problem into a set of binary classification problems, where the binary classification task is to discriminate between data samples and noise samples.

For a brief summary, you can check the session 2 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11786.pdf).


![](imgs/cpc.png)

### Basic idea

latent representations $$z_{t}=g_{enc}(x_{t})$$. An autoregressive model $$g_{ar}$$ summarizes all z<=t  in the latent space and produces a context latent representation $$c_{t}=g_{ar}(z\le t)$$.

Mutual information between original signal x and c: 
$$ 
I(x;c) = \sum_{x,c} p(x,c) log \frac{p(x|c)}{p(x)} 
$$, here is another writing of mutual information because of the bayesian rule(common rule, no extra condition is needed).


predict future observations as $$\frac{p(x_{t+k}|c_{t})}{p(x_{t+k})}$$ 
rather than 
$$p_{k}(x_{t+k}|c_{t})$$

In reality, a simple log-bilinear model $$
f_{k}(x_{t+k},c_{t})=exp(z^{T}_{t+k}W_{k}c_{t})
$$ is used. The authors precise that the linear transformation $$Wc_{t}$$ can be replaced by non-linear models like neural nets.

Given X=$$x_{1},...,x_{N}$$ of N random samples containing one positive sample from $$p(x_{t+k}|c_{t})$$ and N-1 negative samples from the 'proposal' distribution $$
p(x_{t+k})
$$
The final loss(**InfoNCE loss**) is:$$
\mathcal{L}_{N} = - \mathbb{E}_{X} [ log \frac{f_{k}(x_{t+k},c_{t})}{\sum_{x_{j} \in X} f_{k}(x_{j},c_{t})}]
$$

Considering $$f_{k}(.,.)$$ is a **log**-bilinear model, InfoNCE loss can also be viewed as a softmax loss.


#### Optimizing InfoNCE loss is optimizing a **lower bound** on the mutual information between x and c.

The observation(game rule) is 1 positive sample from $$p(x_{t+k}/c_{t})$$ and N-1 negative samples from $$p(x_{t+k})$$. Each event contains 1 positive sample and N-1 negative samples, that's the rule defining an event.

Therefore, The probability of that the i-th sample is positive(meantime the other N-1 is negative) is:

$$
p(d=i|X,c_{t}) = \frac{p(x_{i}|c_{t})\prod_{l \neq i} p(x_{l})}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} p(x_{j}|c_{t}) \prod_{l \neq j} p(x_{l})}
= \frac{p(x_{i}|c_{t})/p(x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} p(x_{j}|c_{t})/p(x_{j})}
$$


A futher provement relating InfoNCE and $$
p(d=i|X,c_{t})$$ can be seen in supplimentary file.

TODO, cannot figure out the logic from Equation 10 to Equation 11. how to induce p(x,c) is equivalant to p(x)?

After finishing traing by InfoNCE loss, the $$g_{enc}$$ is trained optimally so that it can be utilized in many downstream tasks.

**[AMDIM:Learning Representations by Maximizing Mutual
Information Across Views]()**

self-supervised representation learning based on maximizing mutual
information between features extracted from multiple views(**multiple augmentations**) of a shared context(**same image**)

based on previous work Deep InfoMax(DIM,2019).Our model, which we call Augmented Multiscale DIM (AMDIM), extends the local version of Deep InfoMax introduced by Hjelm et al. [2019] in several ways. First, we maximize mutual information between features extracted from independently-augmented copies of each image, rather than between features extracted from a single, unaugmented copy of each image.2 Second, we maximize mutual
information between multiple feature scales simultaneously, rather than between a single global and
local scale. Third, we use a more powerful encoder architecture. Finally, we introduce mixture-based
representations. We now describe local DIM and the components added by our new model.

**[MoCo: Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning,CVPR20](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)**


![](imgs/moco.png)

Preliminary: InfoNCE paper.


A contrastive loss function, called InfoNCE, is considered in this paper. Contrastive loss functions can also be based on other forms , such as margin-based losses and variants of NCE losses. Difference between infoNCE: 1) W in C_{t}W x is inogred here by directly dot product. 

[labels = zeros(N)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/moco/issues/24): nn.CrossEntropyLoss((N),Nx(K+1)), positive sample is always first, therefore labels is all zero.



Relationship with previous works: Compared to another similar idea of memory bank (Wu et al, 2018) which stores representations of all the data points in the database and samples a random set of keys as negative examples, a queue-based dictionary in MoCo enables us to reuse representations of immediate preceding mini-batches of data.

Motivation of queue setting:  removing the oldest mini-batch can be beneficial, because its encoded keys are the most outdated and thus the least consistent with the newest ones.

Motivation of moment update: Using a queue can make the dictionary large, but it also makes it intractable to update the key encoder by back-propagation (the gradient should propagate to all samples in the queue).

dictionary size can be much larger than a typical mini-batch size, and can be flexibly and independently set as a hyper-parameter.

momentum update is  on **the parameter of the encoder**, not the feature of samples.  same pattern also occurs in [mean teacher paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01780.pdf).




In experiments, a relatively large momentum (e.g., m = 0.999, our default) works much better than a smaller value (e.g., m = 0.9), suggesting that a slowly evolving key encoder is a core to making use of a queue.  The temperature  in InfoNCE in is set as 0.07. We set query length K = 65536.

In experiments, we found that using BN prevents the model from learning good representations, as similarly reported in [35] (which avoids using BN). The model appears to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù the pretext task and easily finds a low-loss solution. This is possibly because the intra-batch communication among samples (caused by BN) leaks information. check **A.9. Ablation on Shuffling BN**

 MoCo V1's focus is on a mechanism for general contrastive learning; we do not explore orthogonal factors (such as specific pretext tasks) that may further improve accuracy. As an example, ‚ÄúMoCo v2‚Äù, an extension of a preliminary version of this manuscript, achieves 71.1% accuracy with R50 (up from 60.6%), given small changes on the data augmentation and output projection head. We believe that this additional result shows the generality and robustness of the MoCo framework.



MoCo v1/2 is also useful in CURL which finds MoCo "is extremely useful in Deep RL" (quote Aravind Srinivas, CURL author).<CURL: Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for Reinforcement Learning>

> Multi-head, similar to multi-head transformer: For increased robustness,

![](imgs/clsa-fig1.png)

![](imgs/clsa.png)

- **Intuition**: Instead of applying strongly augmented views to the contrastive loss, we propose to minimize the distribution divergence between the weakly and strongly augmented images
over a representation bank to supervise the retrieval of stronger queries. This avoids an overoptimistic assumption that could overfit the strongly augmented queries containing distorted visual
structures into the positive targets, while still being able to distinguish them from the negative samples by leveraging the distributions of weakly augmented counterparts. The learned representation
will not only explore the novel patterns exposed by the stronger augmentations, but also inherits the
knowledge about the relative similarities to the negative samples.
- Strong aug: In particular, to transform an image, we randomly select an augmentation from
the above 14 types of transformations, and apply it to the image with a probability of 0.5. This
process is repeated five times and that will strongly augment an image as the example shown in the
right panel of Fig. 2.
- Typically, the experiment with a single strong augmentation for each training image takes roughly 70 hours to finish on 8 V100 GPUs.

- image x, feature z, code q, prototype c.  $$ q=z^{T}c $$. B: batch size. K cluster size. C feature dimension from convnet.
- $$ z \in C\times B, q \in B \times K , c \in C \times K$$
-  An alternative to approximate the loss is to approximate the task‚Äîthat is
**to relax the instance discrimination problem. For example, clustering-based methods discriminate
between groups of images with similar features instead of individual images**
- Swapped prediction problem. It seems that method can also work without swapping, it's great if the author can ablate this.
- Check supp for pseudo-code.
- in Moco,SimCLR, ConSup, the negative sample is the image feature of another image. In clustering-based method, the negative sample is the typical feature of other cluster centers( a representative feature of other **all** negatives).
- Note that SwAV is the first self-supervised method to surpass ImageNet supervised features on these datasets, see Table 2.
- Also, Q is not binary(0 and 1 in Sela.ICLR20), Eq 2 is is soft cross-entropy(similar to label smoothing in mixup paper).
- $$tr(Q^{T} C^{T} Z)$$, BxK, KxC, CxB(trace writing here is coherent to the inner product writing in SeLa)  feature z is projected to the unit sphere by L2 normalization; prototype C is updated by gradient descent(Equation 2). Q is a probability matrix(transpotation polytope), as code q is code needed in cross entroy(equation 2), therefore, we need design a method to calculate q by matrix rescaling(better online)
- The online updating of Q is heavily borrowed from [Self-labelling via simultaneous clustering and representation learning,ICLR20](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyx-jyBFPr), why exp(CtZ/e) rather than Plamda in Sela in eq 5?
- multi-crop(large crop and small crop) is crucial, check Figure 3. As noted in prior works [10, 42], comparing random crops of an image plays a central role by capturing information in terms of relations between parts of a scene or an object.
-  Interestingly, multi-crop seems to benefit more clustering-based methods than contrastive methods. We note that multi-crop does not improve the supervised model. see Fig 3.
-  Supervised pretraining is too easy to saturate as model complexity increase. For SwAV, it can still take advantage of it. check Fig 4.
- We distribute the batches over 64 V100 16Gb GPUs, resulting in each GPU treating 64 instances.To help the very beginning of the optimization, we freeze the prototypes during the first epoch of training.Check more details in the supp. learning rate warm up. freeze prototype update in first epoch;
- **Sharp point:**Note that SwAV is more suitable for a multi-node distributed implementation compared to contrastive
approaches SimCLR or MoCo. The latter methods require sharing the feature matrix across all
GPUs at every batch which might become a bottleneck when distributing across many GPUs. On
the contrary, SwAV requires sharing only matrix normalization statistics (sum of rows and columns)
during the Sinkhorn algorithm.
- Number of prototypes is 8k, check C.1

- Experimental analysis is interesting.
- By virtue of the method, the resulting self-labels can be used to quickly learn features for
new architectures using simple cross-entropy training.

**[Labelling unlabelled videos from scratch with multi-modal self-supervision,Arxiv2006](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13662.pdf)**

A large part of the current success of deep learning lies in the effectiveness of
data ‚Äì more precisely: labelled data. Yet, labelling a dataset with human annotation continues to carry high costs, especially for videos. While in the image
domain, recent methods have allowed to generate meaningful (pseudo-) labels
for unlabelled datasets without supervision, this development is missing for the
video domain where learning feature representations is the current focus. In this
work, we a) show that unsupervised labelling of a video dataset does not come
for free from strong feature encoders and b) propose a novel clustering method
that allows pseudo-labelling of a video dataset without any human annotations, by
leveraging the natural correspondence between the audio and visual modalities.
An extensive analysis shows that the resulting clusters have high semantic overlap
to ground truth human labels. We further introduce the first benchmarking results
on unsupervised labelling of common video datasets Kinetics, Kinetics-Sound,
VGG-Sound and AVE.

> Background: Despite the primeval success of clustering approaches in
image classification, very few works [21,22] have been proposed to adapt them to
the end-to-end training of convnets, and never at scale. An issue is that clustering
methods have been primarily designed for linear models on top of fixed features,
and they scarcely work if the features have to be learned simultaneously. For
example, learning a convnet with k-means would lead to a trivial solution where
the features are zeroed, and the clusters are collapsed into a single entity.

> Note that running k-means takes
a third of the time because a forward pass on the full dataset is needed. One
could reassign the clusters every n epochs, but we found out that our setup on
ImageNet (updating the clustering every epoch) was nearly optimal.

- C is dxk matrix, denoting the cenntriod of k centers with dimenstion d. even though K-means is non-parametric clustering. C can be implicitly obtained when convergent.
- Two stage optimization like ADMM. 1). update the parameters of the backbone by predicting these pseudo-labels. 2).update the dxk matrix(centriod feature/clustering center) by the new feature of overall dataset. This type of alternating procedure is prone to trivial solutions. Two tricky ways are introduced to avoid trival solutions.
- Interesting analysis in the experimental part.
- BTW, the order in the matrix is not important, you can even shuffle it, it's not order-sensitive.
