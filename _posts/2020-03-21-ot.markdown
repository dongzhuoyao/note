You need to know the cost per unit c, and the supply amount s and demand amount d in advance.

**EMD in cloud point** starts from [this paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Fan_A_Point_Set_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)

What is c,s,d in Cloud Point? it seems that supply and demand is not a must in this optimal transport problem formulation, check powerpoint [here](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~langloip/data/OptimalTransport.pdf).

It's quite similart to chamfer distance. While chamfer distance is not a bijection, EMD is a bijection.

a auction algorithm-based o(n) approximation solution implementation of OT can be found in [this paper](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mil070/projects/AAAI2020/paper.pdf).

> show how to learn an importance-driven distance metric
via optimal transport programming from batches of samples.It can automatically emphasize hard examples and
lead to significant improvements in convergence. We propose a new batch-wise optimal transport loss and combine
it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. We use it
to learn the distance metric and deep feature representation
jointly for recognition. Empirical results on visual retrieval
and classification tasks with six benchmark datasets, i.e.,
MNIST, CIFAR10, SHREC13, SHREC14, ModelNet10, and
ModelNet40, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method. It can accelerate the convergence rate significantly
while achieving a state-of-the-art recognition performance.
For example, in 3D shape recognition experiments, we show
that our method can achieve better recognition performance
within only 5 epochs than what can be obtained by mainstream 3D shape recognition approaches after 200 epochs.

>  It can be viewed as an n-pairs extension version of the contrastive loss or triplet loss.

- use  Sinkhorn algorithm to solve the appriximation of optimal transport.
- cost is obtained by an attention-based graph neural network. Those costs will be used in optimal transport. Check Figure 3.
- also works directly in pure sift feature, check table 2.
