- A replacement of Convolution block.
- These architectures – SAN10,
SAN15, and SAN19 – are in rough correspondence with
ResNet26, ResNet38, and ResNet50.
- Position encoding is important, see Table 8.
- Robustness of zero-shot generalization to rotated images, adverserial attack is vital to get in.
- A story-telling paper, without comparison with resnext, Sknet. without comparison with combination of conv-block(low-level) and self-attention block(high-level) like non-local paper.

For the fusion layer, the input is WH x H x W. It seems that they try to attend second attention, between WH x WH via 2D convolution. And this module can also be injected in Non-local Block. Overall, you can see the shadow of non-local block in this paper. Some differences I feel are:

- multi-pairs images 
- fusion layer to **further** reason the difference between WHxWH, except the torch.matmul(WHxC,CxWH) in Nonlocal. After all operations, a softmax is appended to finalize the whole attention mechanism.
- You can even see a residual connection after the fusion layer, which is also observsed in non-local block!
- For non-local block, it's not bidirectional, while the author's network is bidirectional. They can influence each other because the correlation layer generates two mutual-transposed matrix via torch.matmul(WHxC,CxWH).

**[A2-nets-double-attention-networks,NIPS18](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7318-a2-nets-double-attention-networks.pdf)**

For SENet, global average pooling is used in the gathering process, while the
resulted single global feature is distributed to all locations, ignoring different needs across locations.
Seeing these shortcomings, we introduce this genetic formulation and propose the Double Attention
block.

Different from the recently proposed Non-local Neural Networks (NL-Nets)  and Double Attention Networks  which only focus on delivering information and
rely on convolution layers for reasoning, our proposed
model is able to directly reason on relations over regions.
Similarly, Squeeze-and-Extension Networks (SE-Nets) 
only focus on incorporating image-level features via global
average pooling, leading to an interaction graph containing
only one node. It is not designed for regional reasoning
as our proposed method. Extensive experiments show that
inserting our GloRe can consistently boost performance of
state-of-the-art CNN architectures on diverse tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation and video action recognition.

- attention matrix is $$(H+W−1)\times WH$$, softmax is applied along $$W+H-1$$ axis.

quite similart o deformable convolution. A fundamental difference to deformable convolution is
that it only learns the offset dependent on the input feature
while the filter weights are fixed for all inputs. In contrast,
our model learns the random walk, weight and affinity as
all being dependent on the input. This property makes our
weights and affinities position-specific whereas deformable
convolution shares the same weight across all convolution
positions in the feature map. learns to sample
a set of K nodes (where K  9) for message passing globally from the whole feature map. This allows our model to
capture a larger receptive field than deformable convolution.

unlike non-local with three inputs, the moudule here has only two input. Check Fig 2. Reshaping from $$H\times W \times S^{2}$$ to $$HW \times S^{2}$$ for forming affinity matrix is a little counter-intuitive. 

divide the feature map X of image I into s×s subregions, running adaptive pooling to generate 1x1,2x2,3x3,4x4... region pooled features.

No softmax is applied around affinity matrix.

**[CARAFE: Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures,ICCV19](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02188.pdf)**


CARAFE can be seamlessly integrated into existing
frameworks where upsampling operators are needed

CARAFE works as a reassembly operator with contentaware kernels. It consists of two steps. The first step is to
predict a reassembly kernel for each target location according to its content, and the second step is to reassemble the features with predicted kernels.

 **[ResNeSt: Split-Attention Networks,Arxiv2002](https://hangzhang.org/files/resnest.pdf)**

As in ResNeXt blocks, the input feature-map can
be divided into several groups along the **channel** dimension, and the number of
feature-map groups is given by a **cardinality** hyperparameter K. We refer to the
resulting feature-map groups as cardinal groups. We introduce a new **radix** hyperparameter R that dictates the number of splits within a cardinal group. Then the block input X are split into G = KR groups along the channel dimension.

Can be seen as a combination of ResNext and SKNet.

**[ECA-Net,CVPR20](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03151)**

 An improvement based on SENet with less parameter and better performance. Check Fig 2. do 1D convolution with kernel size k along feature dimension$$1 \times 1 \times C$$ is a little counter-intuitive for me, there should be no concept of 'neibourhood' in feature dimension.

**LSTM**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)

[https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

Gates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component should be let through. A value of zero means “let nothing through,” while a value of one means “let everything through!” An LSTM has three of these gates, to protect and control the cell state.

intuition: tanh (to push the values to be between −1 and 1) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid( to push the values to be between 0 and 1), so that we only output the parts we decided to.s
